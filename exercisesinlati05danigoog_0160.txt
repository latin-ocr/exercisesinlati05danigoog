whether ¹⁵a11 that we see about us shall stand, or the
whole republic be destroyed.

war against the enemies of the republi03 but the memory
of my deeds will romain. I have ever been mindful of
you and forgetful of myself 3 and Ι shall not hesitate to
execute your decrees, even if the violence of wicked men
shall threaten ¹⁷me with death.
