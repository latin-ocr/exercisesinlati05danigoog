47. 1. After the evidence had all been set forth, the.
senate ¹passed a decree against nine of² the conspirators„
that they should be 3put under guard, and, because Len-
tulus was a praetor, it was decided that he should first
resign his office, ⁴so that there might be no “scruples to
prevent his being punished. ,

2. ⁶A vote of thanks to me was passed, because I had
driven Catiline from the city, and held ⁷under arrest the
infamous leaders of this most accursed war. And also
the senate decreed a thanksgiving to the immortal gods
in my name, because Ι had not only managed the ⁸affairs
of state successfully, but had even saved the state.

3. Now there is no longer anything 9ἓοι· us to fear3 for
all the resources of Catiline, and all his hopes will col·
lapse, 1⁰now that he has been driven from intestine plots
to open marauding. ¹¹As long as he was in the city, ¹²we
had everything to fear5 for he was so active, so bold, so
crafty, so alert iu villany, that we ¹³could have met and
thwarted all his designs only¹⁴ ¹⁵with the greatest diffi-

culty.
