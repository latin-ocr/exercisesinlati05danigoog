77. 1. Alexander the Great had with him many histo-
rians of his exploitS, for he knew that, if he had no one
¹to be the herald of his valor, his name· ²would be buried
in the same tomb that 3should cover his body. And so
our own “Magnus '' awarded a prize to the historian of
his achievementS, Theophanes of Mytilene. His sol-
diers, too, as if they 4had a share in his glory, approved
the act.

2. When Sulla was in Spain, he bestowed citizenship
upon many of the Spaniards; and would he have rejected
ArchiaS, ⁵if he had sought his favor ? He who was so
· eager “to have his actions celebrated in verse that he
lent an ear to the poor poets of Cordova, would not, I
suppose, have sought for the genius and ability⁷ of
Archias,

3. It must be admitted that even⁸ those philosophers

who write treatises on the contempt of glory are them-

selveS,⁸ nevertheless, influenced by the love of praise;
and, in fact, ⁹the best men are most attracted by glory.
Ι do not hesitate to confess to you that I myself⁸ desire
no other reward for my toils aud dangers in your behalf
than the eternal heralding of my virtues,

4. Wherefore, since Archias has done honor in his
verse to the achievements of the Roman people and of
your generals; since he has promised ¹⁰to give an eternal
record of praise 11to you in view of your recent perils3
and since he is ¹²possessed of such a genius that he is
courted by our most distinguished men, I entreat you,
gentlemen of the jury, to receive him under your pro-
tection, so that he may seem to be relieved by your

humanity, ratner than injured by your severity.
