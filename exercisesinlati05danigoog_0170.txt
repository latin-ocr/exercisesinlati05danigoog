timeS, all ageS, and all places3 because they relieve my
mind ³when it is weary with the din and strife of the
Forum3 because by means of them this 4oratorical ability
⁵is improved3 and because Ι am able ⁶to study the por-
trayals of eminent men, which authors have left us in
their bookS. Setting these examples before me, Ι can
educate my mind and judgment by the very contempla-
tion of excellent men.

2. Do you ask whether⁷ all our great commanders have
been trained in literature ἱ) Not a113 for there have been
men of such pre-eminent ⁸natural ability that, even with-
out the aid of learning, they ⁹have shown themselves not
only brave and wise, but well-balanced and dignified.
But it is, nevertheless‚ certain that learning 1⁰is of great
assistance in the cultivation of character.¹¹

3. We all have been accustomed to admire RosciuS‚
but he won our affection by the activity of his body;
and shall we not also admire Archias for the wonderful
activity¹² of his mind ? Why,13 he can recite on the spur
of the moment, 14without writing a single word, most
excellent poetry¹·'·⁵ on the very events that are taking
place ¹⁶around him. Other accomplishments¹⁷ depend

his power from nature itself.

own3 this Archias ²⁰belongs to uS, by his own desire and
by our laws. His voice we ²¹like to hear, because he
celebrates the name and fame of the Roman people.
Grant that our own Ennius was²² dear to the elder
Africanus3 is not Archias aedearly loved by that distin-
guished general, Lucius Lucullus, who opened Pontus
to the Roman people, and routed the innumerable forces
of the Armenians ?
