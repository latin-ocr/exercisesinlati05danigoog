This Series will contain those portions 01 the Latin
authors that are usually read in American schools and
colleges 3 and to meet the growing demand for more
liberal courses such other portions will be included as-
are well fitted for classroom use, but which have hitherto
lacked suitable editionS. In order to furnish permanent
editions 01 uniform merit the work is distributed among
a large number 01 special editorS‚ and the several editions
will be based for the most part upon approved German
editions,

While thus profiting by the valuable results 01 German
scholarship‚ which give the assurance 01 marked excel·
lence to the SerieS‚ each editor will nevertheless verify
all the statements 01 the original, and add to and alter
them as much as may be necessary to adapt his work to
the needs 01 American studentS.

The text will be carefully revised‚ and will be followed
in a separate part 01 the book by a full commentary and
index.

The Series will also contain elementary and supple-
mentary works prepared by competent scholarS. Every
effort will be made to give the books a neat and attrac-

tive appearance.
