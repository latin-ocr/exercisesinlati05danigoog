2. ⁵Methinks she is even now reproaching me ‘for
neglecting the safety of the citizens through fear of un-
popularity. If I should permit Catiline to go from the
city to the camp of Manlius, as⁷ he purposeS, no one will
be so stupid as not to admit that he is no longer a citizen.

3. If he takes with him his whole band of ruined and
desperate men, whom he has collected from all quarterS,
the root and seed of all evils will be stamped out and
destroyed. For a long time the city ⁸has been involved

depart, and follow Catiline out of the city, you will see
