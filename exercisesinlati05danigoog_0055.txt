so alarmed that they sent ambassadors to Caesar, who
spoke after this fashion: “ “they had not thought that
the Romans could move maehines of so great weight;
they yielded⁷ to his power3 one thing they begged‚ -—
⁸that ⁹he would show his eustomary kindneSS‚ and spare
them.” Caesar replied that in the ease of the Nervii he
had ordered their neighbors not to do injury to them,
and that he would spare them10, ¹¹if they should surren-
der before throwing their arms into the ditoh.

3. The townsmen ¹²as a last resort suddenly made a
sortie from the town in the night. Our men, because
they supposed the enemy would fight very fieroely‚
quiokly made signals by fireS‚ and all from the nearest
redoubts ran ¹⁸to the spot where they thought the enemy
were, slew three thousand men, and drove the rest into
the town.

4. At the same time Crassus informed Caesar that he
had reduced all the states that border on the ocean into
the power of the Roman people. After all these aohieve·
ments», Caesar hastened to Italy.
